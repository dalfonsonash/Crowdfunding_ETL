## Project 2: Crowdfunding_ETL
## Team: Payson Cushman, Leo Pierantoni, and Dave Alfonso
For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

Since this is a one-week project, make sure that you have done at least half of your project before the third day of class to stay on track.

Although you and your partner will divide the work, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your partner regularly and offer support.
### Project Goals:
The goals for this project are as follows:

1. Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
2. Create the Campaign DataFrame
3. Create the Contacts DataFrame
4. Create the Crowdfunding Database

#### Project Files

1. Used the ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb to create the necessary .csv files for the database.  
   File renamed ETL_Mini_Project_PCushman_LPierantoni_DAlfonso.ipynb per instructions (see Starter Files folder).
2. Created the following four .csv per instructions (see ..Starter_Files/Resources):
    - category.csv
    - subcategory.csv
    - campaign.csv
    - contacts.csv (used Option 1: Use Python dictionary methods per instructions.)
