## Project 2: Crowdfunding_ETL
## Team: Payson Cushman, Leo Pierantoni, and Dave Alfonso
This is a team project with the purpose of building an ETL (Extract,Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) and a table schema. Finally, weâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

Collaboration and communication is key while working on different parts of the project. 
### Project Goals:
The goals for this project are as follows:

1. Create the Category DataFrame, category.csv 
2. Create the Subcategory DataFrame, subcategory.csv
3. Create the Campaign DataFrame, campaign.csv
4. Create the Contacts DataFrame, contacts.csv
5. Create an ERD and table schema using: https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
6. Create a Postgres Crowdfunding Database


#### Project Files

1. Used the ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code.ipynb to create the necessary .csv files for the database.  
   File renamed ETL_Mini_Project_PCushman_LPierantoni_DAlfonso.ipynb per instructions (see Starter Files folder).
2. Created the following four .csv per instructions (see ..Starter_Files/Resources):
    - category.csv
    - subcategory.csv
    - campaign.csv
    - contacts.csv (used Option 1: Use Python dictionary methods per instructions.)
